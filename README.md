Project Trio: Calculator, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to our Project Trio repository! In this collaborative effort, we've developed three distinct projects that showcase our coding skills and creativity. Each project serves a unique purpose and can be enjoyed independently. Let's take a quick overview:

Calculator

Our calculator application provides a simple and efficient solution for everyday arithmetic. Built with Java and leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, it offers basic operations, decimal input, and more. The intuitive GUI makes it user-friendly for quick calculations.
Future Enhancements
Future plans may involve adding advanced features, such as scientific calculator functions, memory storage, and unit conversion.

Rock-Paper-Scissors

The classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors comes to life in our Java implementation. With a user-friendly interface, players can engage in this timeless game against the computer. The project demonstrates logical decision-making and event-driven programming.
Future Enhancements
Future updates could include expanding the game to Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock, multiplayer capabilities, or even integrating a scoring system.

Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe, a staple of childhood games, is reimagined in our Java application. The two-player game features a graphical interface, and its implementation emphasizes logical board management and user interaction.
Future Enhancements
Future iterations might introduce features like customizable themes, or networked multiplayer options.
